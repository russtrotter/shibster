== What is it? ==

Shibster is a little Java servlet filter that you can run in your container to present HTTP headers to your downstream web applications to make it look to them like you've authenticated against a Shibboleth IdP.

== Building ==

 mvn clean install

== Installing it ==

Shibster is simply a Java Servlet 2.3+ filter so it can be integrated in any multitude of ways, but it's often convenient to keep a development tool like this out of your production code.

==== Container-Wide ====

Apache Tomcat 6.x+ has a global web.xml configuration that all running web applications share.

# Copy the jar
 mkdir $CATALINA_BASE/lib
 cp target/shibster-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar $CATALINA_BASE/lib

# Wire in the filter
 edit $CATALINA_BASE/conf/web.xml, see "Configuration" below

==== Single Application ====

# Copy the jar
 cp target/shibster-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar .../myapp/WEB-INF/lib
 edit .../myapp/WEB-INF/web, see "Configuration" below

== Configuration ==
The following summarizes the filter init-param's that can be configured:
||Parameter||Description||Required||Default||
|contexts|Specifies the servlet context root paths that shibster is active|Yes|None|
|headers|Specifies the HTTP headers to pass to the downstream application.  The syntax is standard Java properties-based. The property "REMOTE_USER" in this data is treated specially and stored in both the HTTP header as well as the return of the javax.servlet.ServletRequest.getRemoteUser() API call.|Yes|None|


==== Example Configuration ====

The following example is used in front of a uPortal instance that is wired up for Shibboleth authentication
